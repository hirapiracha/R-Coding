Dear all,

for our first class, you should do the following to be prepared:

**Slack**

In order to participate in the class, you will be required to participate in the (private) Slack for this class. I prefer Slack over Moodle, thus I am asking you to sign up for an account for this class:

1. Go to Moodle and follow the link to sign up
2. Reply to my message asking you to introduce yourself briefly

If you don't seem to receive confirmation emails (or other emails), make sure to check your spam folders, both for CEU and your private accounts, depending on which email you provided and how you forward emails.

**GitHub Account and Repository**

1. Go to the github repository for this class: https://github.com/MarcKaufmann/R-Coding
2. Complete all the steps in README.md under *Lecture 0: Technical Prerequisites before Class 1*

**Syllabus and where to get updates**

The syllabus in the GitHub repository is the up-to-date one, and I might change it mildly over time -- Moodle (or elsewhere) will not necessarily be updated.

**If you have questions**

Slack should be your first option when you have a question, in particular for technical questions, since others may benefit from them. Feel free to email me if Slack does not fit the question. Please let me know if and when you find ambiguities that you are unsure about.

See you all in class.

Best,
Marc
