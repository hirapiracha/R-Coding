# Syllabus

## Coding 1: Data Management and Analysis with R

- Instructor: Kaufmann Marc; Email: KaufmannM@ceu.edu
- Credits: 2 CEU (4 ECTS) 
- Term: Winder 2023-2024
- Course level:  MA/MSc
- Prerequisites: None

## Course description

The course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and software environment for data exploration, data munging, data analysis, and data visualization. 

### Learning outcomes

- Produce meaningful descriptive statistics and informative graphs
- Become familiar with the R ecosystem 
- Learn how to get help, how to debug, how to do basic programming
- Learn how to use R for the most common data tasks: loading, cleaning, transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data

### Reading list

Class materials are hosted on https://github.com/MarcKaufmann/R-Coding. Look there for an up-to-date syllabus.

### Assessment 

- Four data reports (100 points)
  - 15, 20, 25, and 40 points respectively (increasing over time)

There will be no final exam. 

The grading thresholds are those set by CEU (see https://documents.ceu.edu/documents/p-1105-2v2304, Annex 2).

If you have a question regarding a particular assignment -- whether about the grade or otherwise -- make sure to email me.

### Technical/laptop requirement

You will need your laptop with RStudio and R installed in order to participate in class. Optionally, you can install git too.

### Tentative Course schedule 

**Note:** This is subject to reording and minor changes, but the broad set of topics should remain fairly stable.

1. R ecosystem, basic syntax; how to get help; first plot
1. ggplot2: data visualization; introduction to functions
1. Tidyverse: choosing data with `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`
1. Tidyverse: transforming data with `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `group_by()`
1. Tidyverse: more transformations with `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `filter()`
1. Tidyverse: reading data with `read_csv()` and `parse_*()`
1. Tidyverse: tidying data with `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`
1. Tidyverse: `left_join()` and `join()`
1. Visualizing Spatial Data

Items spread across lectures:

* Functions, loops, and friends; sampling, simulating, bootstrapping (GD)
* working with data the non-tidyverse way; lubridate for working with dates

Additional topics (time permitting):

* Shiny apps
